        <h2>Brian Maag - Pastor</h2>

        <p>
          I grew up in the Chicago area, about a half hour west of the city. Believe it or not, I grew up a shy kid, the youngest (by far) of my three siblings. I went to big schools (a high school graduating class of 800, an undergrad university of 21,000), so coming to pastor a church in a town of 9,500 was a bit of a shift for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing my undergrad at Illinois State University, one of my oldest friends invited me to Downers Grove Community Church, where I got the chance to start practicing ministry. I did youth ministry with a partner whom I would eventually marry, while pursuing a professional career as an IT consultant. After our youth ministry grew, God began putting the pieces together to get me into seminary to study ministry full-time. Five years and many adventures later, I graduated from Northern Seminary in 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
          That September, my wife Rachael and I moved from Chicago to Newark to begin ministry here at Woodlane. Since then, our family has grown with the birth of our children Andrew, Sarah, and Leah. They must break some record of having the most adopted grandmas and grandpas at the church and Andrew, when he was two, began a trend of getting people involved in the benediction after our worship service!
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not enjoying ministry (and I really do enjoy it), you can probably catch me on the road running, playing some form of musical instrument, reading or getting ready for my next obstacle course race. I believe at this stage of life, Ferris Bueller got it right "Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and take a look around, you could miss it."

            I have just retired from Wayne County 911 after 35 years. My husband, Roy & I have been married for 36 years.  We have lived in Clyde for 20 years with our 3 dogs & a cat.  Roy’s daughter lives in Michigan with her husband & our grandchildren, Alex-16 & Alli-13.

            In my spare time I enjoy making jewelry, gardening, walking our dogs & visiting the grandchildren.

            Please pray for me as I try to fill Debbie’s shoes here at our church.
